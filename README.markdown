Ruby-GProv
==========

Description
-----------

This is a ruby implementation of the Ruby implementation of the [Google
Provisioning API][api]. It's designed to provide an object oriented approach to
the API instead of the weird procedural approach that's the straight
implementation. By and large it's modelled in the manner of CRUD.

[api]: http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/gdata_provisioning_api_v2.0_reference.html "Google Provisioning API v2.0"

Examples

provisioning API.
