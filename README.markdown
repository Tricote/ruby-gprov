Ruby-GProv
==========

Synopsis
--------

This is a ruby implementation of the Ruby implementation of the [Google Provisioning API][api].

Description
-----------

The specification of the Google Provisioning API is primarily procedural in
nature, despite that all the languages that Google provides bindings for are
object oriented. This implementation attempts to provide a more natural
interface to that API. Where applicable, objects present a CRUD-like set of
methods to perform operations on the underlying system.

provisioning API.
